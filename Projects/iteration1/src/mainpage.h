 * This is iteration 1 of the robot project, a simple two-dimensional video game
 * in which the user drives a robot around to capture bases while avoiding bad guys.
 * The graphics are all powered by nanoGUI and nanoVGL. Additionally, this is what 
 * drives the game. The game is contained within a rectangular arena, and all entities 
 * in the arena inheret from the base class ArenaEntity. The game itself allows for the
 * user to pause/play, drive the robot around with the arrow keys, and reset the game 
 * with a "new game" button.
